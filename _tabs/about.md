I'm an undergrad student who is passionate about tech and curious on how systems work. My focus is on Digital Forensics & Incident Response, IoT, Data Analysis, Reverse Engineering, and Threat Intelligence. This site serves as a chill space for articles on security research, technical blogs, and CTF write-ups.
